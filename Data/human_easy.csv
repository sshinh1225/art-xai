1,A Danish Coast,"LUNDBYE, Johan Thomas",landscape,Danish,1801-1850,"The painting shows a view from Kitnas on Roskilde Fjord, Zeeland. When the painter decided to depict a Danish coastline in an unusually monumental format, the scene was to represent the quintessential characteristic of the Danish countryside: the extensive coastlines. The scene does not, in fact, depict a single, specific site, the main motif is based on cliffs that the artist saw and sketched at the Roskilde Fjord. He adapted these cliffs, making them rather more monumental, and combined them with scenes from elsewhere",23474-danishco.jpg,05645-allegor1.jpg,22274-abductio.jpg,16887-keswick.jpg,07159-canal110.jpg,35665-deesis2.jpg,32083-underbru.jpg,05555-12marull.jpg,41178-zchrist1.jpg,26254-selfporx.jpg,1
2,A View of Souda Island,"VELDE, Peter van den",landscape,Flemish,1651-1700,"The painting shows a view of Souda Island, Crete with a Turkish galley and two Dutch ships.Souda is situated on the NW coast of Crete. On Souda Island the Venetians built a castle in 1573 to reinforce the defence of the port of Souda and to control the Gulf entrance. The construction works were finished within a year but until the Turkish invasion of Crete in 1645 improvements were regularly made",21468-queen.jpg,05487-2predell.jpg,38632-bp_advic.jpg,38597-guardrox.jpg,10534-madonna.jpg,08407-madchild.jpg,31738-01figure.jpg,00097-still_fr.jpg,24460-crucifix.jpg,42377-souda.jpg,10
3,A Winter Scene,"OSTADE, Isaack van",landscape,Dutch,1601-1650,"Isack van Ostade was the short-lived younger brother of the painter of scenes from peasant life, Adriaen van Ostade. They were both born, lived and worked in Haarlem, and Isack was a pupil of his brother who was eleven years his senior. Isack joined the guild in 1643. His earliest paintings - the first dated picture is from 1639 - are peasant interiors dependent on Adriaen's, but towards the end of his brief career he became more interested in outdoor scenes and produced a series of beautiful and original landscapes, often set in winter. This deliberately picturesque view, its low viewpoint serving to outline the wooden bridge against the sky, is one of his finest paintings. It is rich in its treatment of the details of peasant life, whose harsh aspects (as seen, for example, in the figure of the man labouring under his load of faggots) are relieved by the pleasure taken by the child in the anticipation of skating on the frozen river.",30774-6transf.jpg,29969-winter_s.jpg,34926-07gartem.jpg,36018-orator15.jpg,18638-3view3lr.jpg,33405-06passio.jpg,09498-1wedding.jpg,30066-3wolfgaa.jpg,42315-1006vela.jpg,06087-taylor_s.jpg,2

7,Allegory on the Death of the Dauphin,"LAGRENE, Louis-Jean-Franois",mythological,French,1751-1800,"Legrane received several royal commissions in a busy life. In the Allegory on the Death of the Dauphin the figures are not strictly allegorical, apart from the sorrowing France behind the bed, for they represent the dauphine and the couple's sons (including the dead one who appears with a crown of stars for his dying father), the effect is of allegory rather than fact. And the idiom in which the picture is painted is certainly classical, much as interpreted by Batoni, though critics of the day it suggested Guido Reni",10300-06woman4.jpg,39579-12cherry.jpg,09052-sunshine.jpg,33465-00mythol.jpg,04123-peasants.jpg,08420-figures.jpg,21367-allegory.jpg,12460-villers.jpg,10201-charity1.jpg,32774-08portra.jpg,7

9,Caf in Paris,"KOROVIN, Konstantin Alekseyevich",landscape,Russian,1851-1900,"Korovin was surely the purest Russian Impressionist, the closest to the French spirit, which his several visits to western Europe after 1885 familiarized him with. His early works were nonetheless closer to the precise draughtsmanship and narrative interest of a Caillebotte or Forain than to Monet, twenty years his senior",07499-271y_ram.jpg,21189-cafepari.jpg,03973-bello201.jpg,15755-tobias_a.jpg,32173-louis_13.jpg,33335-1socrate.jpg,20141-vijgeboo.jpg,21562-abraham.jpg,18089-9tobias.jpg,20590-banquet.jpg,2
10,Caritas (Charity),"CRANACH, Lucas the Elder",religious,German,1501-1550,"From 1529 Lucas Cranach the Elder, and his son Lucas the Younger depicted the Christian virtue of Love, Caritas or Charitas, in some dozen different versions. It happened only in individual pictures, where Caritas (Charity) does not appear in the company of the seven (or more) virtues and vices. The earlier clothed personification - the idealised figure of a woman - has been replaced by the picture of a young mother. She sits in blissful nakedness on a stone bench, her legs modestly crossed, with only a thin veil covering her head and shoulders. She breastfeeds her baby and allows two somewhat larger boys to cling on her.This composition later appeared in many other versions. The present version is amongst the earliest of Cranach's numerous variants of Caritas pictures. It is signed and of high quality",10300-06woman4.jpg,39579-12cherry.jpg,09052-sunshine.jpg,33465-00mythol.jpg,04123-peasants.jpg,08420-figures.jpg,21367-allegory.jpg,12460-villers.jpg,10201-charity1.jpg,32774-08portra.jpg,9
11,"Christ Blessing, Surrounded by a Donor Family (central panel)","UNKNOWN MASTER, German",religious,German,1551-1600,"In this triptych a family of seven gathers closely around the central figure of Christ as Salvator Mundi. The table in the centre is strewn with cut flowers.Through the biblical verses inscribed overhead, the family engages in a dialogue with Christ on salvation and afterlife. On the central tablet affixed to the green canopy appear Jesus's words ""Because I live, ye shall live also"" (John 14:19). The four eldest family members respond with invocatory verses from the Book of Psalms on plaques hung from hooks on the rear wall.The city depicted in Christ's orb is Hamburg, shown in a topographically accurate view from the east",23474-danishco.jpg,05645-allegor1.jpg,22274-abductio.jpg,16887-keswick.jpg,07159-canal110.jpg,35665-deesis2.jpg,32083-underbru.jpg,05555-12marull.jpg,41178-zchrist1.jpg,26254-selfporx.jpg,9
12,Crucifixion,MASACCIO,religious,Italian,1401-1450,"On February 19th 1426 Masaccio agreed to paint an altarpiece for a chapel in the church of the Carmine in Pisa for the sum of 80 florins. On December 26th of that year the work must have been already completed since payment for it is recorded on this date. Vasari gave a detailed description of the work which was the basis for art critics for the attempt at reconstruction and for the recovery and identification of the work which was dismantled and dispersed in the 18th century. Only eleven pieces have so far come to light and they are not sufficient to enable a reliable reconstruction of the whole work. The Crucifixion is one of the eleven panels (one of the top panels) connected with the Pisa Polyptych.As in the main panel, the Gothic arch determines the pictorial frame, the upward stress of which Masaccio modifies in his composition. To counter the vertical trust imposed by the arch, Masaccio creates a strong horizontal effect with the rather exaggerated extension of the arms of Christ on the cross. Although Masaccio still uses the gilt background for his representation, the atmospheric effects remain hauntingly convincing.",21468-queen.jpg,05487-2predell.jpg,38632-bp_advic.jpg,38597-guardrox.jpg,10534-madonna.jpg,08407-madchild.jpg,31738-01figure.jpg,00097-still_fr.jpg,24460-crucifix.jpg,42377-souda.jpg,9
13,Deesis Range: The Archangel Michael,"RUBLYOV, Andrey",religious,Russian,1401-1450,"The iconostasis is the elaborately painted wall of icons that separates the Holy Apse from the main nave of an Orthodox church. It has a varying number of tiers. In Byzantine art, the Deesis is a traditional iconic representation of Christ in Majesty enthroned, carrying a book, and flanked by the Virgin Mary and St John the Baptist, and sometimes other saints and angels. The Deesis was often placed above the Holy Door of the iconostasisThe picture shows the left icon from the Deesis Range in Zvenigorod",23474-danishco.jpg,05645-allegor1.jpg,22274-abductio.jpg,16887-keswick.jpg,07159-canal110.jpg,35665-deesis2.jpg,32083-underbru.jpg,05555-12marull.jpg,41178-zchrist1.jpg,26254-selfporx.jpg,6

16,Figures in a Tree-lined Avenue,"CERQUOZZI, Michelangelo",landscape,Italian,1601-1650,"A 1692 Chigi inventory lists two paintings, the Rural Scene (see at Angeluccio) and the Figures in a Tree-lined Avenue and indicates that they are the product of a collaboration between Angeluccio, who painted the landscape, and Michelangelo Cerquozzi, who painted the figures.Though Miel and van Bloemen also painted figures for Angeluccio's landscapes, the majority of his collaborations were with Michelangelo Cerquozzi. Angeluccio seems to have furnished background landscapes for his fellow ""Bamboccianti"" much as Viviano Codazzi executed architectural backgrounds for them. A hypothesis has even been advanced that the nickname ""Angeluccio"" is derived from the closeness of this artist to ""Michele Angelo"" Cerquozzi. The fruits of this collaboration entered into numerous important Roman collections in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the inventories of which either report the pictures as ""by Angeluccio with figures by Cerquozzi"", or as landscapes by Angeluccio alone",10300-06woman4.jpg,39579-12cherry.jpg,09052-sunshine.jpg,33465-00mythol.jpg,04123-peasants.jpg,08420-figures.jpg,21367-allegory.jpg,12460-villers.jpg,10201-charity1.jpg,32774-08portra.jpg,6
17,Guardroom with Monkeys,"TENIERS, David the Younger",genre,Flemish,1651-1700,"In a large, open, barn-like structure, which serves as a guardroom, groups of monkeys wearing soldiers' uniforms are grouped around tables playing cards and back-gammon.Pictures of monkeys had been popular from the sixteenth-century and it was Teniers who developed the theme in the seventeenth-century. The primary role of the monkey in visual and literary sources of the sixteenth-century was to represent the irrational and foolish side of man's nature, but monkeys also were symbols of sinfulness and seen as devils",21468-queen.jpg,05487-2predell.jpg,38632-bp_advic.jpg,38597-guardrox.jpg,10534-madonna.jpg,08407-madchild.jpg,31738-01figure.jpg,00097-still_fr.jpg,24460-crucifix.jpg,42377-souda.jpg,4
18,Harvest at Montfoucault,"PISSARRO, Camille",landscape,French,1851-1900,"Pissarro's landscapes include the people who live and work there; unlike his Impressionist friends Monet and Renoir, these are not city people who travel to the country to relax on the weekend, but peasant farmers and their wives, herdsmen, and shepherdesses. Yet, unlike Millet, Pissarro does not monumentalise his agricultural labourers. They are not posed, and they themselves form an integral part of the landscape",21468-queen.jpg,05487-2predell.jpg,38632-bp_advic.jpg,38597-guardrox.jpg,10534-madonna.jpg,08407-madchild.jpg,31738-01figure.jpg,00097-still_fr.jpg,24460-crucifix.jpg,42377-souda.jpg,7
19,Infanta Margarita,"VELZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y",portrait,Spanish,1601-1650,"At the end of the 1640s Velzquez was on the threshold to his late work and the peak of his artistic achievement, to which his likenesses of the Spanish Habsburgs, not least, made a considerable contribution. They are among the finest examples of court portraiture ever painted. This picture represents Infanta Margarita, born on 12 July 1651, daughter of Philip IV and his second wife, Mariana. The Infanta is the central figure of Velï¿½zquez's famous composition, Las Meninas, painted three years later",30774-6transf.jpg,29969-winter_s.jpg,34926-07gartem.jpg,36018-orator15.jpg,18638-3view3lr.jpg,33405-06passio.jpg,09498-1wedding.jpg,30066-3wolfgaa.jpg,42315-1006vela.jpg,06087-taylor_s.jpg,9
20,Interior of a Tailor's Shop,"BREKELENKAM, Quiringh van",genre,Dutch,1651-1700,"Quiringh van Brekelenkam worked in Leiden, where he was influenced by Dou's domestic subjects and by Metsu's broad touch and intense colours. He is best known for his paintings of men and women artisans working at various crafts: cobblers, lace makers, spinners, fish mongers, and so forth. Outstanding is his Tailor's Shop of 1653 at the Worcester Art Museum where he finds quiet poetry in a view of a humble interior with the master and his two apprentices at work, seated tailor-fashion on the table while an old woman prepares a meal. Thirteen variations of the Worcester painting have been recorded (fine ones are at Amsterdam, London, Philadelphia, and Bonn); an indication that there must have been a good market for the motif. Like so many genre painters of his time, he turned to more elegant subjects in the sixties",30774-6transf.jpg,29969-winter_s.jpg,34926-07gartem.jpg,36018-orator15.jpg,18638-3view3lr.jpg,33405-06passio.jpg,09498-1wedding.jpg,30066-3wolfgaa.jpg,42315-1006vela.jpg,06087-taylor_s.jpg,10

22,Judith,"MANTEGNA, Andrea",religious,Italian,1451-1500,"Once owned by King Charles I of England, this painting illustrates an episode from the Old Testament which relates how the Israelite Judith by guile killed the Assyrian general Holofernes and thus saved her beleaguered city. Painted with minute detail, Judith and her handmaiden finish their deed with tragic calm.Among Mantegna's works there are several representations of Judith that, without exception, show a comparatively peaceful scene in which Judith is placing the severed head of Holofernes in a bag. During the Baroque, in contrast, the dramatic central moment of the action was preferred, as Judith, often with great effort, decapitates Holofernes.",38414-selfport.jpg,18726-guard106.jpg,25224-karlstei.jpg,24095-4judith.jpg,35969-landscap.jpg,38264-maurice.jpg,38105-vanitas.jpg,14843-konigsbr.jpg,39173-10valmar.jpg,18625-3view.jpg,4

24,Landscape with Shepherds and Sheep,"BONZI, Pietro Paolo",landscape,Italian,1601-1650,"During his lifetime Bonzi was particularly renowned for his still-lifes, but, like Filippo Napoletano, he was also active as a painter of landscapes. His output in this genre became entangled with that of Agostino Tassi, even though the two do not really have much in common. In addition to this canvas, Bonzi's certain works include The Martyrdom of St Sebastian and The Rest of Hercules (both in the Pinacoteca Capitolina, Rome), Nymph and Faun (Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica di Palazzo Barberini, Rome) and Latona and the Frogs (Musï¿½e du Louvre, Paris).Bonzi was clearly influenced by Annibale Carracci and to an even greater extent by Domenichino, but his compositions are more open on both sides and his terrain much flatter. His foregrounds spread out freely without obstacles such as large rocks or bushes, almost inviting the viewer to walk into the picture. His rather awkward figures tend to move parallel to the picture plane in a frieze-like procession. In the early 1620s he worked at the Palazzo Borghese on the Quirinal hill with Filippo Napoletano, each decorating different rooms. In this landscape Bonzi's close attention to naturalistic detail suggests the influence of Bril. Establishing a chronology for Bonzi's landscapes is almost impossible, but this work is perhaps not too far in date from the Pallavicini-Rospigliosi frescoes. The shepherds' nakedness indicates that the scene is not contemporary (even though sheep-farming had largely replaced cultivation in the Roman campagna around this time), but rather an episode from Virgil's Arcadia",14509-burning.jpg,05055-landscap.jpg,36785-rotherhi.jpg,23919-denial.jpg,19317-palatine.jpg,17299-selfpo26.jpg,30730-huquier.jpg,20118-49hoock.jpg,22346-4elemen4.jpg,34358-giudecc.jpg,2

Midas wished that everything he touched be turned to gold, but soon realized his mistake when all food became inedible. Bacchus ordered him to wash in the River Pactolus in Lydia. Hence the popular aetiology of the gold-bearing properties of the river, thought to have been the source of wealth of the kings of Lydia, of whom Croesus was the last.Midas is depicted penitently before Bacchus, a drunken Silenus sleeping nearby.

33,Munich Beer Garden,"LIEBERMANN, Max",genre,German,1851-1900,Adolf von Menzel's virtuoso use of colour influenced his German Impressionist successors. Liebermann's Munich Beer Garden most strikingly reveals his debt to Menzel,19034-lakenami.jpg,08784-madchild.jpg,41679-1virgin.jpg,42784-2wall1.jpg,22311-02beerga.jpg,02764-eccehomo.jpg,09897-courb402.jpg,07998-magnani.jpg,31826-findmose.jpg,13385-u2sibyl.jpg,5
34,Noah's Ark,"ROMANESQUE PAINTER, French",religious,French,1051-1100,"The fresco cycle in the vault of the monastery church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe narrates stories from the Old Testament in a rather confusing sequence. When establishing the narrative composition, priority was given to the arrangement of narrative events rather than to the continuous narrative flow. Thus, popular subjects, such as Noah's Ark, were made to stand out in spectacular fashion.As was common in the Middle Ages, the artist who created this picture showed the ark as a lateral elevation. Judging by its hull, the ark is a Viking ship with a stem fortified by monsters, and a three-story superstructure and small wheel-house just as described in the Bible. Animals look out through the round-arched windows, and Noah's family crouch above",30774-6transf.jpg,29969-winter_s.jpg,34926-07gartem.jpg,36018-orator15.jpg,18638-3view3lr.jpg,33405-06passio.jpg,09498-1wedding.jpg,30066-3wolfgaa.jpg,42315-1006vela.jpg,06087-taylor_s.jpg,3
35,Paintings of Saints,MASTER THEODERIC,religious,Bohemian,1351-1400,"Master Theoderic, a highly original artist, broke free of the styles that were dominated by Italian, Austrian and French art and tried to develop his own distinctive style. Painted between 1360 and 1365, the 30 icon-like portraits of the saints which decorate the Chapel of the Cross at Karlstein Castle are one of the most impressive results of these efforts. The robust features of the individual saints are impressively depicted.Three-dimensional objects have been added, such as carved coats-of-arms, mounted in the manner of collages on the surface of the paintings. Ornamented with discs of gilded Venetian glass and strips of marble encrusted with semiprecious stones, the chapel seems like a Byzantine treasure chamber. It is possible that this room and the adjacent 'privatorium' were intended by the Emperor to create a vision of his future Eastern empire",38414-selfport.jpg,18726-guard106.jpg,25224-karlstei.jpg,24095-4judith.jpg,35969-landscap.jpg,38264-maurice.jpg,38105-vanitas.jpg,14843-konigsbr.jpg,39173-10valmar.jpg,18625-3view.jpg,3
36,Paternal Admonition (Gallant Conversation),"TERBORCH, Gerard",genre,Dutch,1651-1700,"This painting having the popular title of Parental Admonition (another version in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin) was the subject of a charming passage by Goethe. In his ""Die Wahlverwandtschaften"" Goethe notes the delicacy of attitude of the figures. He remarks how the father quietly and moderately admonishes his daughter who is seen from behind. The woman in black, sipping from a glass, Goethe interprets as the young woman's mother, who lowers her eyes so as not to be too attentive to the 'father's admonition'. This moralizing title, however, is without foundation and not in accordance with Ter Borch's usual themes.The authoritative biographer of the artist interprets the picture in the opposite sense, as a brothel scene, assuming that the seated gentleman holds a coin in his right hand, offering it to the girl. In fact, the detail of the coin is not visible. (The coin is omitted in the engraving Goethe knew). In the Berlin version the passage is rubbed; a former owner may have had it painted over because she or he found it an embarrassing allusion. The Amsterdam version does not show the coin either, but its original paint surface is generally abraded; thus it is impossible to tell if it ever included the tell-tale coin.Ter Borch's psychology is so delicate that the  common scenes he repeatedly painted are raised to the level of highly civilized life. That Goethe's interpretation was possible at all shows the refinement of Ter Borch's treatment. Even if he made a mistake, Goethe had the right feeling for the way Ter Borch treated his subjects. Psychologically and pictorially he retains a sensitive touch and delicacy. The young woman is seen from behind; thus her face is averted. The only flesh visible is her neck, which is modelled with tender, silvery grey shadows. We have, however, opportunity to admire the silver-grey satin and black velvet of her gown.Ter Borch's minuteness and nicety of handling concentrate largely on painting stuffs. Contrary to Vermeer's paintings, the dim light and the subdued chiaroscuro do not allow a forceful grasp of the whole field of vision. The light comes mostly from the front and stops at the glossy surfaces of the costumes and other textures",21468-queen.jpg,05487-2predell.jpg,38632-bp_advic.jpg,38597-guardrox.jpg,10534-madonna.jpg,08407-madchild.jpg,31738-01figure.jpg,00097-still_fr.jpg,24460-crucifix.jpg,42377-souda.jpg,3
37,Peasants with Cattle by a Ruined Aqueduct,"BERCHEM, Nicolaes",landscape,Dutch,1651-1700,"Nicolaes Berchem, the son of a distinguished still-life painter, Pieter Claesz., was born in Haarlem. The town was a leading centre of landscape painting in the early seventeenth century and among Berchem's teachers was the landscapist Jan van Goyen. Like many Dutch artists, Berchem travelled to Italy immediately after completing his apprenticeship. He was in Rome late in 1642 and remained there for three years. While in Italy, Berchem made many drawings of the landscape of the Roman Campagna, its cattle and peasants.On his return to Haarlem Berchem quarried this rich material throughout a long and extremely productive career, painting (and etching) hundreds of Italianate pastoral scenes. As is evident from this painting, he interpreted the Italian landscape and the life of its peasants in an idyllic manner, emphasizing its timeless continuity by the inclusion of antique monuments. These buildings cannot be identified, as they are only loosely modelled on actual ruins. Berchem uses a bright, highly-coloured palette and applies the paint in short, stabbing brush strokes.In seventeenth-century Holland there was a constant demand for exotic landscapes of this type and Berchem was a highly successful artist. He moved to Amsterdam, which had a larger art market than Haarlem, in about 1677. His work was widely imitated and copied during his lifetime and his paintings enthusiastically sought after in France in the eighteenth century and in England in the nineteenth. This painting, having been in the distinguished Amsterdam collection of Gerrit Braamcamp in the mid-eighteenth century, was bought in Paris by the Duc de Chabot in 1780 and in London in 1840 by Sir Robert Peel",10300-06woman4.jpg,39579-12cherry.jpg,09052-sunshine.jpg,33465-00mythol.jpg,04123-peasants.jpg,08420-figures.jpg,21367-allegory.jpg,12460-villers.jpg,10201-charity1.jpg,32774-08portra.jpg,5

39,Portrait of a Man,"BOTTICELLI, Sandro",portrait,Italian,1451-1500,"According to Berenson, the sitter of this portrait is Michele Marullo (1453-1500), known as Tarcaniota, a Greek humanist, who was the guest of the Medici's between 1489 and 1495. Later, in 1496, he returned to Florence and married the woman poet Alessandra Scala. He left Florence in 1490 and soon after he died by drowning into the river Cecina.This painting can be considered an ideal scholar portrait, a forerunner of those portrayals of philosopher-heroes developed in the seventeenth century, e.g. by Luca Giordano.The painting is in a very poor state of preservation",23474-danishco.jpg,05645-allegor1.jpg,22274-abductio.jpg,16887-keswick.jpg,07159-canal110.jpg,35665-deesis2.jpg,32083-underbru.jpg,05555-12marull.jpg,41178-zchrist1.jpg,26254-selfporx.jpg,8

47,Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at the Bal Costum of 12 May 1842,"LANDSEER, Sir Edwin Henry",historical,English,1801-1850,"Three fancy-dress balls were held at Buckingham Palace by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, each in a different style. At the first on 12 May 1842 the principal figures appeared as Edward III (1312-77) and Queen Philippa (1314?-69). The second, on 6 June 1845, was in early Georgian dress and the third, on 13 June 1851, in the style of the Restoration.Landseer has painted Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in the Throne Room on the occasion of the fancy-dress ball of 1842, standing beneath a specially designed Gothic canopy decorated with purple velvet hangings. Two chairs of state are visible behind the figures and above their heads on the cloth of honour is emblazoned the coat-of-arms of Edward III, combining French and English quarterings. It was from this alcove that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert greeted over 2,000 guests. Members of the Royal Household were expected to appear in costumes dating in style from the reign of Edward III, while the guests were encouraged to wear costumes of any period or country. The setting for the ball and the design of the costumes were entrusted to James Robinson Planche, who was an authority on the history of dress, as evidenced by his encyclopaedic book History of British Costume (1834), as well as a dramatist and a herald in the College of Arms.The costumes worn by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were designed by Vouillon and Laure with the guidance of Planche. For the sake of accuracy reference was made to the relevant monuments in Westminster Abbey. The queen's costume was based upon the effigies of Philippa of Hainault and her daughter Blanche de la Tour (died in infancy 1342), while that for Prince Albert was derived from the effigy of Edward III. Landseer began his painting at the time of the ball, but, as was so often the case with this artist, progress was delayed and the picture was not finished until 1846.",21468-queen.jpg,05487-2predell.jpg,38632-bp_advic.jpg,38597-guardrox.jpg,10534-madonna.jpg,08407-madchild.jpg,31738-01figure.jpg,00097-still_fr.jpg,24460-crucifix.jpg,42377-souda.jpg,1

50,Romulus and Remus Suckled by the Wolf,"CARRACCI, Lodovico",historical,Italian,1551-1600,"This scene is part of the frescoed frieze painted in 1588-91 by the Carracci in the salone on the piano nobile of the Palazzo Magnani in Bologna. The frieze depicts in 15 scenes the stories of the founding of Rome. The iconographical program of the frieze precisely follows the story of ""Parallel Lives"" by Plutarch. Each scene is accompanied by a motto written on a scroll beneath each box.One of the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf. The twin brothers were purported to be sons of the Rhea Silvia and Mars, the god of war. Because of a prophecy that they would overthrow their murderous uncle, they were abandoned at birth and put into a basket that was then placed into the River Tiber. The basket ran aground and the twins were discovered by a female wolf. The wolf nursed the babies for a short time before they were found by a shepherd. The shepherd then brought up the twins.When Romulus and Remus became adults, they decided to found a city where the wolf had found them. The brothers quarrelled over where the site should be and Remus was killed by his brother. This left Romulus the sole founder of the new city and he gave his name to it &#150; Rome. The date given for the founding of Rome is 753 BC.Romulus and Remus Suckled by the Wolf is the first scene of the cycle. It was executed by Lodovico Carracci. The motto beneath the scene reads: ""LAESI NON NECATI ALIMVR"" (Wounded, not killed, we are fed)",19034-lakenami.jpg,08784-madchild.jpg,41679-1virgin.jpg,42784-2wall1.jpg,22311-02beerga.jpg,02764-eccehomo.jpg,09897-courb402.jpg,07998-magnani.jpg,31826-findmose.jpg,13385-u2sibyl.jpg,8

54,Self-Portrait in front of the Easel,"GOGH, Vincent van",portrait,Dutch,1851-1900,"Catalogue numbers: F 522, JH 1356.Shortly before he left Paris and moved to Provence in late February 1888, van Gogh painted this final self-portrait. He is no longer dressed as the urban dandy, but in the blue blouson of the Parisian working class. He stands before his easel, holding his palette in a pose intentionally reminiscent of a self-portrait by Rembrandt which was then in the Louvre and well known to van Gogh. Perhaps the painting should be read as a kind of manifesto of the new orientation in his conception of himself as an artist and of his work - the intention to remove himself from the city and its bourgeois lifestyle, and the desire to be seen in a Dutch rather than a French tradition. The painting also betrays a growing confidence in himself as an artist: he appears with the insignia of his profession. Greater assurance is also evident in the handling. The earlier extreme experimentation with pure or broken colour and a textured and structuring brushwork has given way to a more controlled and coherent treatment. In the pose he has used, van Gogh evokes Rembrandt; but the painterly treatment and coloration remind us of another seventeenth-century Dutch artist - Frans Hals. The lessons van Gogh had learnt in Antwerp, explored in greater depth throughout the Paris period, are now successfully integrated into his work to produce a distinctive style",14509-burning.jpg,05055-landscap.jpg,36785-rotherhi.jpg,23919-denial.jpg,19317-palatine.jpg,17299-selfpo26.jpg,30730-huquier.jpg,20118-49hoock.jpg,22346-4elemen4.jpg,34358-giudecc.jpg,6

The main panels with which the upper register has been framed since 1925 represent the Madonna and Child with angels, flanked by, on the left, Sts Augustine and Catherine of Alexandria and, on the right, Sts Appolonia and Nicholas of Tolentino.St Jerome is the most moving of the figural panels in the upper register. He is shown with his symbol, the lion, placing its paws on the saint while licking him as would a dog. Jerome is scrutinizing the text of the Vulgate, which he holds in front of him. Staring at the text through gilded pince-nez, his brows knitted in concentration, he reads aloud, his mouth half open, revealing white teeth.The panels forming the upper register come from the Benedictine abbey in Gualdo Tadino, which must have been the original location of the altarpiece to which they belonged",00476-virgin_c.jpg,16883-sheba.jpg,34062-3renoi10.jpg,40782-portkuni.jpg,32214-19midas.jpg,40733-01icon.jpg,16534-s_jerome.jpg,25051-double1.jpg,20473-emmaus.jpg,38567-gallery4.jpg,7
59,St John the Baptist (Youth with Ram),CARAVAGGIO,religious,Italian,1551-1600,"This painting exists in two versions, both of which are probably by Caravaggio (who frequently copied his own paintings). Both versions are in Rome, the other in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj.The image is a masterpiece of virtuosity whose appeal lies in its soft, caressing light and velvety rendering of cloth, flesh, and plants. The figure is identifiable as St John only virtue of the symbols of Christ displayed in the painting: the ram (sacrificial victim), and the grape-leaves (from whose red juice, akin to the blood of Christ, springs life); otherwise the iconographical subject (the simple, immediately apparent image) appears as a nude youth with an ironic, if not allusive, expression. Its cultivated content and its destination for an aristocratic patron are underscored by the artist's explicit use of a great figurative source of the past: Michelangelo's Ignudi from the Sistine Ceiling. But whereas Michelangelo created abstract and ideal figures with cold lights and a merely theoretical plasticism, Caravaggio models his figure on the careful observation of nature, achieving an image of perfect realism",07499-271y_ram.jpg,21189-cafepari.jpg,03973-bello201.jpg,15755-tobias_a.jpg,32173-louis_13.jpg,33335-1socrate.jpg,20141-vijgeboo.jpg,21562-abraham.jpg,18089-9tobias.jpg,20590-banquet.jpg,1
60,St Maurice and the Angel,"STROZZI, Bernardo",religious,Italian,1601-1650,"St Maurice is a legendary warrior saint, the commander of the 'Theban Legion', Roman troops from Thebes in Egypt, who served at Agaunum in Gaul (St-Maurice en Valais) in the 3rd century. He is dressed in medieval armour. The story, whose authenticity is debated, relates that the soldiers, at the instigation of Maurice, refused to participate in certain pagan rites. They were punished by the Emperor Maximian Herculeus first by decimation and finally by the wholesale massacre of the legion. Maurice and his fellow officers were executed in A.D. 287.According to another interpretation, the warrior saint is identified as St Secundus",38414-selfport.jpg,18726-guard106.jpg,25224-karlstei.jpg,24095-4judith.jpg,35969-landscap.jpg,38264-maurice.jpg,38105-vanitas.jpg,14843-konigsbr.jpg,39173-10valmar.jpg,18625-3view.jpg,6
61,St Sebastian Reproving Diocletian,"VERONESE, Paolo",religious,Italian,1551-1600,"Veronese painted the frescoes on the upper part of the nave of San Sebastiano between March and September 1558. The main pictures, representing ST Sebastian Reproving Diocletian and The Martyrdom of St Sebastian are located in the chancel. Painted architecture plays a preponderant role in these frescoes: a mock portico with columns, niches and windows frames them. They are treated like theatrical scenery",19034-lakenami.jpg,08784-madchild.jpg,41679-1virgin.jpg,42784-2wall1.jpg,22311-02beerga.jpg,02764-eccehomo.jpg,09897-courb402.jpg,07998-magnani.jpg,31826-findmose.jpg,13385-u2sibyl.jpg,4
62,St Stephen of Hungary,"CRANACH, Lucas the Elder",religious,German,1501-1550,The medium-sized panel with the saintly king formed the left wing of an altar retable in several sections. It probably represents St Stephen (Istvn) of Hungary. King Stephen I (969-1038) is the Hungarian national hero whose missionary projects among the heathen Magyars completed the conversion of the country to Christianity,14906-early08.jpg,00881-10north.jpg,42664-donatian.jpg,43366-sacra_co.jpg,08796-dry_tree.jpg,43874-haarlem.jpg,10095-23altar.jpg,31921-stillif1.jpg,28641-1vario16.jpg,03281-gimignan.jpg,7

Ponce's use of this effect strongly indicates the indirect influence of Caravaggio's Basket of Fruit in the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, Milan, almost 50 years after it was created",14906-early08.jpg,00881-10north.jpg,42664-donatian.jpg,43366-sacra_co.jpg,08796-dry_tree.jpg,43874-haarlem.jpg,10095-23altar.jpg,31921-stillif1.jpg,28641-1vario16.jpg,03281-gimignan.jpg,8
65,Still-Life with Fruit and Crystal Vase,"AELST, Willem van",still-life,Dutch,1651-1700,"Intense colours characterize the still-lifes of Van Aelst, who worked for a time in France and Italy. In this painting, which was commissioned by Cardinal Giovan Carlo de' Medici, the intense blue of the table-cloth catches one's eye. The large crystal vase in the centre of the composition was probably in the possession of the Medici family. The painter placed his signature and the date on the hem of the white tablecloth: W.A.Aelst. 1652",21468-queen.jpg,05487-2predell.jpg,38632-bp_advic.jpg,38597-guardrox.jpg,10534-madonna.jpg,08407-madchild.jpg,31738-01figure.jpg,00097-still_fr.jpg,24460-crucifix.jpg,42377-souda.jpg,8
66,Sunshine,"CLAUS, Emile",landscape,Belgian,1851-1900,"As a result of their approach to Impressionism, Belgian artists occasionally juxtaposed native Flemish styles with imported Impressionist styles derived from the French. One of the major exponents of the more French-oriented line was Emile Claus, who painted in the style of Monet. Paintings such as Sunshine and A Corner of My Garden show how intensely he grappled with the phenomenon of light and different atmospheric conditions. His subjects, frequently landscapes, recall Monet",10300-06woman4.jpg,39579-12cherry.jpg,09052-sunshine.jpg,33465-00mythol.jpg,04123-peasants.jpg,08420-figures.jpg,21367-allegory.jpg,12460-villers.jpg,10201-charity1.jpg,32774-08portra.jpg,3
67,Supper at Emmaus,JACOPO DA EMPOLI,religious,Italian,1551-1600,The painter represented this subject in two paintings (in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and in the Hermitage). These are half-figure compositions on a neutral dark background in which the figure of Christ is almost identical,00476-virgin_c.jpg,16883-sheba.jpg,34062-3renoi10.jpg,40782-portkuni.jpg,32214-19midas.jpg,40733-01icon.jpg,16534-s_jerome.jpg,25051-double1.jpg,20473-emmaus.jpg,38567-gallery4.jpg,9
68,The Abduction of Helen of Troy,LIBERALE da Verona,historical,Italian,1451-1500,"This panel belonged to a cassone from which another panel with The Rape of Europa is in the Muse du Louvre, Paris.In Greek mythology, Helen of Troy, also known as Helen of Sparta, was the daughter of Zeus and Leda, and was a sister of Castor, Pollux, and Clytemnestra. In Greek myths, she was considered to be the most beautiful woman in the world. Her abduction by Paris brought about the Trojan War",23474-danishco.jpg,05645-allegor1.jpg,22274-abductio.jpg,16887-keswick.jpg,07159-canal110.jpg,35665-deesis2.jpg,32083-underbru.jpg,05555-12marull.jpg,41178-zchrist1.jpg,26254-selfporx.jpg,3
69,The Adoration of the Magi,MASTER of the Holy Kinship,religious,German,1501-1550,"This double-sided panel once formed the wing of a now lost altarpiece, with the Adoration of the Magi originally serving as the interior panel and the Throne of Grace as the exterior. Formerly, the panel was in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. It was sold for the Acquisitions Fund in 2013.The style of this master and his workshop was greatly influenced by Flemish painters, in particular, Hugo van der Goes, whose Monforte Altarpiece may be seen as a direct inspiration for the individual figures in this work (particularly the second kneeling King in the Adoration). Furthermore, the picture is indicative of the influence which Rogier van der Weyden had on the group of Cologne painters working at the turn of the 16th century. Such influence on the present work can be seen in Rogier's Columba Altarpiece, which utilizes a similar spatial construction and figural arrangement found in the Adoration here",00476-virgin_c.jpg,16883-sheba.jpg,34062-3renoi10.jpg,40782-portkuni.jpg,32214-19midas.jpg,40733-01icon.jpg,16534-s_jerome.jpg,25051-double1.jpg,20473-emmaus.jpg,38567-gallery4.jpg,8
70,The Art Collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels,"TENIERS, David the Younger",interior,Flemish,1651-1700,"The huge collection owned by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria (1614-1662), Governor of the Spanish Netherlands from 1646 to 1656, was dominated by 16th-century Italian painting but contained a fair proportion of contemporary Flemish works by Van Dyck, Rubens, and others. When he stepped down as governor, he took his collection back to Austria where it is now the nucleus of the collections of paintings in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna",00476-virgin_c.jpg,16883-sheba.jpg,34062-3renoi10.jpg,40782-portkuni.jpg,32214-19midas.jpg,40733-01icon.jpg,16534-s_jerome.jpg,25051-double1.jpg,20473-emmaus.jpg,38567-gallery4.jpg,10
71,The Burning Bush,"FROMENT, Nicolas",religious,French,1451-1500,"This work of Froment's maturity, which is indeed an epitome of his whole oeuvre, was commissioned by King Ren of Provence. This central panel of the triptych represents Moses before the Burning Bush; the figures kneeling in prayer on the wing are the donor and his wife, Jeanne de Laval, accompanied by saints (not reproduced here). In this work the painter has abandoned the occasional crudities of The Raising of Lazarus; only in the countenance of Moses are there reminiscences of the more rigid portraiture of the earlier altarpiece. Moses is struck with astonishment at the vision before him and the appearance of the angel. The vision occupies the upper centre of the picture: amidst a great circle of flaming rose bushes the Madonna appears in a richly draped mantle, holding the Child. Christ holds a mirror in his hand, in which both of them are reflected. The picture contains a number of emblematical representations. The combination of a number of unusual elements side by side is characteristic of mediaeval symbolism. It is evidence of the extraordinary cult of the Virgin in the Middle Ages that it is she who appears before Moses, and not God, as in the Old Testament",14509-burning.jpg,05055-landscap.jpg,36785-rotherhi.jpg,23919-denial.jpg,19317-palatine.jpg,17299-selfpo26.jpg,30730-huquier.jpg,20118-49hoock.jpg,22346-4elemen4.jpg,34358-giudecc.jpg,1
72,The Denial of St Peter,"MANFREDI, Bartolomeo",religious,Italian,1601-1650,"Manfredi created a series of theatrically lit compositions in which bawdy figures crowd around a table gambling, drinking and making music. In his Denial of St Peter the tavern scene is transformed into a religious narrative in which the soldiers' game of dice is given more prominence than Peter's betrayal. The religious event is thus cast within the context of secular life",14509-burning.jpg,05055-landscap.jpg,36785-rotherhi.jpg,23919-denial.jpg,19317-palatine.jpg,17299-selfpo26.jpg,30730-huquier.jpg,20118-49hoock.jpg,22346-4elemen4.jpg,34358-giudecc.jpg,4

74,The Four Elements and Ages of Man: Water and Old Age,"LIEVENS, Jan",mythological,Dutch,1601-1650,This painting is part of a series of four representing the personification of the four elements and the four ages of man. The fourth painting of the series combines water with old age. Old Age is depicted as a fishmonger with pail and fish-tube.,14509-burning.jpg,05055-landscap.jpg,36785-rotherhi.jpg,23919-denial.jpg,19317-palatine.jpg,17299-selfpo26.jpg,30730-huquier.jpg,20118-49hoock.jpg,22346-4elemen4.jpg,34358-giudecc.jpg,9
75,"The Garden in Winter, Rue Carcel","GAUGUIN, Paul",landscape,French,1851-1900,"By 1883, and as a direct result of the collapse of the stock market the previous year, Gauguin's finances were in disarray, and he began to consider a change in career. This painting demonstrates an attempt to align himself with the landscape Impressionist painters, perhaps from a desire to make money from the sale of his works, and is in marked contrast to the more laboured works produced while he could still consider himself an amateur.The subject of a snowy landscape was a typical Impressionist device to enable the artist to study the effects of colour reflections on a white surface and was particularly favoured by Sisley. However, the handling in the sky and the foliage is more reminiscent of the work of Monet from this period. The spontaneity of the brushwork and the subject matter would suggest that the canvas was painted out of doors, but there is a small related sketch without the two foreground figures, probably done in front of the motif, which presumably forms the basis for this more finished, studio painting. This means that the two women were added later, and demonstrates that even at this date Gauguin did not feel tied to working solely from nature, and had already begun to use the subject of two conversing women which was to recur in his mature work",14906-early08.jpg,00881-10north.jpg,42664-donatian.jpg,43366-sacra_co.jpg,08796-dry_tree.jpg,43874-haarlem.jpg,10095-23altar.jpg,31921-stillif1.jpg,28641-1vario16.jpg,03281-gimignan.jpg,1
76,The Ghent Altarpiece: Erythraean Sibyl,"EYCK, Jan van",religious,Flemish,1401-1450,The Erythraean and Cumaean Sibyls are related to the Annunciation through their prophecies.

79,The Madonna della Salute,"UNKNOWN ICON PAINTER, Cretan",religious,Greek,1101-1150,"The centre of the high altar in the Santa Maria della Salute holds the icon of the Madonna of Health, installed here in November 1670. It came from Candia cathedral where it was known as the San Tito Madonna or Mesopanditissa (after the day on which it was celebrated, between Christmas and the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple). Doge Morosini brought it to Venice as a trophy after peace had been made with the Turks at the end of the Candia war. Tradition has it that the artist was St Luke the Evangelist and that it is consequently a miraculous sacred image, but it was actually the work of a 12th century Madonna painter. The shadowed face and penetrating eyes are particularly effective",00476-virgin_c.jpg,16883-sheba.jpg,34062-3renoi10.jpg,40782-portkuni.jpg,32214-19midas.jpg,40733-01icon.jpg,16534-s_jerome.jpg,25051-double1.jpg,20473-emmaus.jpg,38567-gallery4.jpg,6

Numerous watercolours document his travels and depict ruined Egyptian temples. In adventurous compilations of oriental components he succeeded in intensifying the fairy-tale element into historic imaginative depictions, as in the Queen of Sheba, which is fantastic and theatrical in both colouring and scenery",00476-virgin_c.jpg,16883-sheba.jpg,34062-3renoi10.jpg,40782-portkuni.jpg,32214-19midas.jpg,40733-01icon.jpg,16534-s_jerome.jpg,25051-double1.jpg,20473-emmaus.jpg,38567-gallery4.jpg,2

82,The Virgin of the Dry Tree,"CHRISTUS, Petrus",religious,Flemish,1451-1500,"This small panel is a puzzling composition which conceals a complex symbolism. The painting is a late work by Christus, who from 1462 was a member of the Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Dry Tree. The dry and thorny branches could be a prefiguration of the Crown of Thorns, but the painting has also been interpreted as an early representation of the Immaculate Conception.

83,The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis,CORNELIS VAN HAARLEM,mythological,Dutch,1551-1600,"The Haarlem government commissioned this painting to decorate a guesthouse for the Orange family and other dignitaries. The painting's reference to the beginnings of the Trojan War presented an impressive reminder that even trivial discord causes devastating wars. This was a topical message in Haarlem, which had suffered debilitating defeat in a Spanish siege of 1573. The work also showcased Haarlem's patronage of sophisticated international history painting.In this painting, depicting events leading up to the Trojan War, Cornelis van Haarlem represented the assembled gods as naked muscle-men and soft-skinned women, in endlessly varied poses. Their idealized, heroic bodies befit their immortality and the ominous event they witness. These figures were clearly based on drawings after the nude which Cornelis could have made in the small academy in Haarlem. His grand style would have reminded knowledgeable viewers of the history painting of the Italian Renaissance, specifically of Michelangelo and his followers, and of the praise for idealized nudity and difficult poses in sophisticated art theory",30774-6transf.jpg,29969-winter_s.jpg,34926-07gartem.jpg,36018-orator15.jpg,18638-3view3lr.jpg,33405-06passio.jpg,09498-1wedding.jpg,30066-3wolfgaa.jpg,42315-1006vela.jpg,06087-taylor_s.jpg,7

Tobias was sent by his father Tobit to Media to recover a sum of money he had hidden there earlier. Archangel Raphael, sent by God to help Tobit and his family, asked Tobit (who did not recognize the angel) whether he may escort his son on his journey and, in company with Tobias' faithful hound, they departed together. They reached the Tigris, where Tobias was attacked by a gigantic fish. The archangel ordered him to capture it and had him remove and conserve its gall, heart and liver.

In his first period in Naples he painted fish and kitchen still-lifes in great variety. In the late 1640s he moved to Rome and, after coming into contact with the Northern European masters Matthias Withoos and Otto Marseus van Schrieck, active in the city at that time, he began to produce his famous underbrush paintings.

Looking North-East from there the whole of the longest straight stretch of the canal is visible, as far as the Rialto Bridge, part of which is shown in the far distance, with the roof and dome of the church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo beyond.",23474-danishco.jpg,05645-allegor1.jpg,22274-abductio.jpg,16887-keswick.jpg,07159-canal110.jpg,35665-deesis2.jpg,32083-underbru.jpg,05555-12marull.jpg,41178-zchrist1.jpg,26254-selfporx.jpg,5
90,View of Haarlem,"WEISSENBRUCH, Jan Hendrik",landscape,Dutch,1851-1900,"For Weissenbruch and other artists of the Hague School, with their knowledge of Dutch 17th-century art and the Barbizon School, plain air painting became fundamental. Taking Daubigny's floating studio as their model, Weissenbruch and Roelofs regularly went out in boats. Weissenbruch's spacious Dutch scenes, such as View of Haarlem, contrast in their use of bolder and broader brushwork. In their own specific lyrical way, drawing foremost on the colourist juxtaposition of silvery blues and greens with warmer shades, Weissenbruch paintings nicely captured the moist atmosphere that lies upon Dutch landscapes",14906-early08.jpg,00881-10north.jpg,42664-donatian.jpg,43366-sacra_co.jpg,08796-dry_tree.jpg,43874-haarlem.jpg,10095-23altar.jpg,31921-stillif1.jpg,28641-1vario16.jpg,03281-gimignan.jpg,6
91,"View of Keswick, in the Lake District, Cumberland","GLOVER, John",landscape,English,1801-1850,"Glover had a house at Blowick Farm near Patterdale, at the foot of Ullswater Lake, and spent much of his time in the Lake District. He was so fond of the region that, when in Tasmania, where he settled from 1831, he reminiscently named his house Patterdale",23474-danishco.jpg,05645-allegor1.jpg,22274-abductio.jpg,16887-keswick.jpg,07159-canal110.jpg,35665-deesis2.jpg,32083-underbru.jpg,05555-12marull.jpg,41178-zchrist1.jpg,26254-selfporx.jpg,4
92,View of Lake Nemi,"HACKERT, Jacob Philipp",landscape,German,1751-1800,"This signed and dated painting provides a view of the Lake Nemi from the north, with the town of Nemi and the town of Genzano beyond, with a donkey and travellers on a path in the foreground.Similar views of the Lake Nemi were painted by other 18th-century painters such as Claude-Joseph Vernet, John Robert Cozens, Joseph Wright, Solomon Delane, and  Nicolas-Didier Boguet",19034-lakenami.jpg,08784-madchild.jpg,41679-1virgin.jpg,42784-2wall1.jpg,22311-02beerga.jpg,02764-eccehomo.jpg,09897-courb402.jpg,07998-magnani.jpg,31826-findmose.jpg,13385-u2sibyl.jpg,1
93,View of the Giudecca Canal,"RICHTER, Johan",landscape,Swedish,1701-1750,The most original paintings by the Swedish artist depict the Venetian lagoons enlivened by boats. The architecture is represented down to the smallest detail.

94,Virgin and Child,"AMIGONI, Jacopo",religious,Italian,1701-1750,Amigoni treated this subject about fifteen times during his career.

95,Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints (Sacra Conversazione),"VIVARINI, Alvise",religious,Italian,1451-1500,"The heavy plasticity of Bartolomeo Vivarini and Andrea da Murano was soon surpassed by the more balanced and harmonious three-dimensional quality of the works of Antonello da Messina. His St Cassiano altarpiece of 1476, fragments of which are now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna was studied and admired by a whole generation of painters. One of the first to be inspired by it was Alvise Vivarini, son of Antonio and follower of his uncle Bartolomeo, who soon went on to become a major exponent of Antonello's theories of crystalline form and colour. His major work coming from the first and much-admired studio of Messina is the Sacra Conversazione dated 1480, originally in the church of San Francesco in Treviso.The painting is composed with geometrical symmetry: the two groups of saints, Louis of Toulouse, Anthony of Padua and Anne on the left and Joachim, Bernardino and Francesco Gioacchino on the right, face inwards towards the enthroned Virgin. In their gestures immobilized by the cold light which comes from the top left-hand corner, the three-dimensional figures appear to form a kind of architecture the centre of which is the throne, a construction of cylinders and parallelepipeds, behind which the curtain falls heavily excluding from sight all natural elements apart from two small fragments of a cold, clouded sky. Shadows appear to cut into the floor, confirmation of the geometrical relationship between space and figures, while the clear line delineates areas of pure enamel-like colour. This theory of formal abstraction was to become during the last few years of the 15th century still more monumental, in contrast to the ideas of colourization and sublime naturalness represented by Giovanni Bellini.Recent examination has revealed that the green curtain in the background was added at a later date. The panel is signed and dated on the dais of the throne",14906-early08.jpg,00881-10north.jpg,42664-donatian.jpg,43366-sacra_co.jpg,08796-dry_tree.jpg,43874-haarlem.jpg,10095-23altar.jpg,31921-stillif1.jpg,28641-1vario16.jpg,03281-gimignan.jpg,4

97,Vision of St Augustine,"BOTTICELLI, Sandro",religious,Italian,1451-1500,"The picture shows the second predella panel of the St Barnaba Altarpiece.According to a legend, St Augustine the bishop, while he was thinking about the Holy Trinity, met a child on the beach who was attempting to use a spoon to transfer the waters of the ocean into a small hole. When Augustine explained to him that this was not possible, the child replied that it was far more foolish to try to find an explanation for the mystery of the Trinity",21468-queen.jpg,05487-2predell.jpg,38632-bp_advic.jpg,38597-guardrox.jpg,10534-madonna.jpg,08407-madchild.jpg,31738-01figure.jpg,00097-still_fr.jpg,24460-crucifix.jpg,42377-souda.jpg,2

99,Votive pictures,"SALIMBENI, Lorenzo",religious,Italian,1401-1450,"The lower register of the east wall includes several votive pictures, separately framed but also painted on the wall, that must have been executed at roughly the same time as the cycle. The two pictures of the Madonna, the Madonna dell'Umilt&#224; and Madonna with Saints, are also attributed to the Salimbeni brothers for stylistic reasons. These paintings flank a niche, producing the effect of a triptych",30774-6transf.jpg,29969-winter_s.jpg,34926-07gartem.jpg,36018-orator15.jpg,18638-3view3lr.jpg,33405-06passio.jpg,09498-1wedding.jpg,30066-3wolfgaa.jpg,42315-1006vela.jpg,06087-taylor_s.jpg,4
100,"Woman with a Water Pitcher, and a Man by a Bed","HOOCH, Pieter de",genre,Dutch,1651-1700,"This painting is one of De Hooch's variations on an amorous theme. The motif of pulling on a stocking and that of a dog nosing about were both recognized in De Hooch's day as sexual innuendos when the context supported such readings.The painting is a fragment of a broader canvas, it has lost about 17 cm on the right",14509-burning.jpg,05055-landscap.jpg,36785-rotherhi.jpg,23919-denial.jpg,19317-palatine.jpg,17299-selfpo26.jpg,30730-huquier.jpg,20118-49hoock.jpg,22346-4elemen4.jpg,34358-giudecc.jpg,8
