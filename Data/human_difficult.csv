1,A View of Souda Island,"VELDE, Peter van den",landscape,Flemish,1651-1700,"The painting shows a view of Souda Island, Crete with a Turkish galley and two Dutch ships.Souda is situated on the NW coast of Crete. On Souda Island the Venetians built a castle in 1573 to reinforce the defence of the port of Souda and to control the Gulf entrance. The construction works were finished within a year but until the Turkish invasion of Crete in 1645 improvements were regularly made",42377-souda.jpg,42512-cathedra.jpg,09373-leaping.jpg,08420-figures.jpg,35839-valkhof1.jpg,19686-westerke.jpg,29474-landsuns.jpg,04410-landscap.jpg,18726-guard106.jpg,04981-moonlit.jpg,1
2,Adoration of the Magi,"MANTEGNA, Andrea",religious,Italian,1451-1500,"Between 1490 and 1506, the year he died, Mantegna painted several devotional paintings in which the main figures are represented as reliefs standing out against a mostly dark background. Inspired by reliefs on classical tombs, these figures are shown partially hidden behind stone balustrades or a frame.The subject of Adoration of the Magi was one of the most popular in all fifteenth-century art, especially for the opportunities it presented for the display of rich costumes and accessories, and of numerous subordinate figures with horses and other animals in an extensive landscape. Mantegna, however, restricts his composition to just six figures - with the three magi on the right converging on the three members of the Holy Family on the left - which he shows in half-length, and hence, too, in powerfully expressive close-up. Four decades earlier, when still working as a young man in Padua, Mantegna had introduced this type of half-length devotional narrative into Italian painting with his Presentation in the Temple.It was suggested that this painting was executed for Isabella d'Este, the consort of Marquis Francesco Gonzaga",14788-giustina.jpg,24109-95magi.jpg,17505-14virgin.jpg,16385-chris13.jpg,10534-madonna.jpg,08864-12peter.jpg,02764-eccehomo.jpg,23189-32monaco.jpg,34269-phaeton.jpg,24000-zeno04.jpg,2

6,Apotheosis of St Charles Borromeo,"ROTTMAYR, Johann Michael",religious,Austrian,1701-1750,"This painting is an oil sketch (modello) for the principal altarpiece in the east transept of the Kollegienkirche in Salzburg, built by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach (1656-1723) between 1696 and 1707. This altarpiece is one of the most important works from Rottmayr's later period. The modello is a smaller version of the six-meter high altarpiece and reproduces the elongation and distortion of the figures which create the perspective of the altarpiece itself.St Charles Borromeo was the intercessor for people stricken with the plague. In response to an outbreak of the plague epidemic in the city of Salzburg, processions are held and Holy Communion is administered following the example of St Charles Borromeo. Rottmayr defined the location of the event by depicting recognisable features of the Salzburg landscape and architecture.Rottmayr's style of painting was shaped by and bears the imprint of his schooling in the Italian, and above all Venetian, art of painting in the sixteenth century",36799-carrying.jpg,35316-sketch1.jpg,25926-cremona1.jpg,05439-110madon.jpg,17474-3malvag4.jpg,00954-02virgin.jpg,37575-cleopatr.jpg,04511-virgin_c.jpg,40266-organ_2.jpg,16534-s_jerome.jpg,2

15,Deesis Range: The Archangel Michael,"RUBLYOV, Andrey",religious,Russian,1401-1450,"The iconostasis is the elaborately painted wall of icons that separates the Holy Apse from the main nave of an Orthodox church. It has a varying number of tiers. In Byzantine art, the Deesis is a traditional iconic representation of Christ in Majesty enthroned, carrying a book, and flanked by the Virgin Mary and St John the Baptist, and sometimes other saints and angels.

16,Diptych,"WEYDEN, Rogier van der",religious,Flemish,1401-1450,"The two small panels, representing the Madonna and St Catherine of Alexandria, respectively, probably formed a diptych.The busts of prophets on the outside of the Ghent Altarpiece by Jan van Eyck were the model for the bust of God the Father at the top of the left panel. The figures of Adam and Eve were from the same source. The picture is usually regarded as an early work by Rogier himself from the years 1432-35, but the figure of the Madonna is probably after Jan van Eyck's Madonna of the Fountain, dated 1439, in Antwerp.The right panel is rather weaker, and is not by the same painter as the Madonna. As a king's daughter, Catherine has a crown, but she has taken it off, perhaps a sign of humility and reverence before the Madonna, and has placed it on the ground to lie there ignored. The wheel, her attribute, refers to the failure of the attempt to break her on the wheel; the martyr was finally beheaded with a sword",43957-2luke.jpg,05008-findmose.jpg,32539-mad_chil.jpg,32267-19gather.jpg,00781-3predel4.jpg,25224-karlstei.jpg,01094-christ.jpg,37004-service.jpg,44046-1diptych.jpg,04389-annuncia.jpg,9
17,Dutch Reformed Service in the Grote Kerk of Weesp,"SIBILLA, Gijsbert Jansz.",religious,Dutch,1601-1650,"The Grote Kerk in Weesp was originally a Catholic church consecrated to St Lawrence, in 1582 it became Protestant and its name was changed from Laurentiuskerk to Grote Kerk.For Dutch architectural painters the people in the church served as staffage to enliven the stone setting. This is different with Sibilla: for him the architecture is not central, but rather the depicted persons, who are very large in relation to the building. About seventy can be counted, a few of whom seem to be portraits. Certain elements, such as the dogs, bring a genre scene to mind. The combination of a church interior, group portrait, and genre scene is unique in Sibilla's oeuvre",43957-2luke.jpg,05008-findmose.jpg,32539-mad_chil.jpg,32267-19gather.jpg,00781-3predel4.jpg,25224-karlstei.jpg,01094-christ.jpg,37004-service.jpg,44046-1diptych.jpg,04389-annuncia.jpg,8

20,Fall of Phaethon,"RICCI, Sebastiano",religious,Italian,1701-1750,"In Greek mythology Phaethon was the son of Helios, the sun-god. Helios drove his golden chariot, a 'quadriga' yoked to a team of four horses abreast, daily across the sky. Phaethon persuaded his unwilling father to allow him for one day to drive his chariot across the skies. Because he had no skill he was soon in trouble, and the climax came when he met the fearful Scorpion of the zodiac. He dropped the reins, the horses bolted and caused the earth itself to catch fire. In the nick of time Jupiter, father of the goods, put a stop to his escapade with a thunderbolt which wrecked the chariot and sent Phaethon hurtling down in flames into the River Eridanus (according to some, the Po). He was buried by nymphs.  Phaethons's reckless attempt to drive his father's chariot made him the symbol of all who aspire to that which lies beyond their capabilities.Undoubtedly Sebastiano Ricci's dashing virtuoso technique had its roots in the Baroque. In his hands, however, it was translated into an explosive, light-hearted energy.",14788-giustina.jpg,24109-95magi.jpg,17505-14virgin.jpg,16385-chris13.jpg,10534-madonna.jpg,08864-12peter.jpg,02764-eccehomo.jpg,23189-32monaco.jpg,34269-phaeton.jpg,24000-zeno04.jpg,9
21,Fete in a Wood,"LANCRET, Nicolas",genre,French,1701-1750,"The composition reflects Lancret's dependence on Watteau, under whom he had briefly studied c. 1717. Watteau's profound poetic feeling becomes in Lancret no more than a picturesque and amiable evocation of the life of society",08667-01soap.jpg,20578-company5.jpg,04578-pendant2.jpg,29311-painter.jpg,09848-courb111.jpg,04586-young_gi.jpg,06918-elegantw.jpg,21435-fetewood.jpg,22942-09ridott.jpg,03173-spicesho.jpg,8
22,Figures in a Tree-lined Avenue,"CERQUOZZI, Michelangelo",landscape,Italian,1601-1650,"A 1692 Chigi inventory lists two paintings, the Rural Scene (see at Angeluccio) and the Figures in a Tree-lined Avenue and indicates that they are the product of a collaboration between Angeluccio, who painted the landscape, and Michelangelo Cerquozzi, who painted the figures.Though Miel and van Bloemen also painted figures for Angeluccio's landscapes, the majority of his collaborations were with Michelangelo Cerquozzi. Angeluccio seems to have furnished background landscapes for his fellow ""Bamboccianti"" much as Viviano Codazzi executed architectural backgrounds for them. A hypothesis has even been advanced that the nickname ""Angeluccio"" is derived from the closeness of this artist to ""Michele Angelo"" Cerquozzi. The fruits of this collaboration entered into numerous important Roman collections in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the inventories of which either report the pictures as ""by Angeluccio with figures by Cerquozzi"", or as landscapes by Angeluccio alone",42377-souda.jpg,42512-cathedra.jpg,09373-leaping.jpg,08420-figures.jpg,35839-valkhof1.jpg,19686-westerke.jpg,29474-landsuns.jpg,04410-landscap.jpg,18726-guard106.jpg,04981-moonlit.jpg,4
23,Flight to Egypt,"MELONE, Altobello",religious,Italian,1501-1550,"The early decades of the sixteenth century in Cremona were some of the most turbulent in its political history. In these years of constantly changing foreign rulers, the local leaders of Cremona pursued an elaborate project of decoration with remarkable consistency. From 1506 to 1522 the community had the chancel and nave of the twelve-century cathedral frescoed. By continuing the decoration through all the changes in government, the community represented its own identity; it was an act of local self-assertion.The decoration was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the fa�ade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the fa�ade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino painted the scenes above the first four arches of the nave, and Giovan Francesco Bembo had been active above the fifth arch. He was not awarded another commission, the fresco cycle was continued by the Cremonese artist Altobello Melone. His contract regarding the frescoes above the next arch stipulated that his works should surpass in beauty Boccaccino's frescoes of the first two arches, which had been unveiled in 1515. Melone painted the Flight to Egypt and the Massacre of the Innocents with a wealth of motifs and drastic narrative. The protagonists have left the ideal, solemnly harmonious sphere of joyful childhood that Boccaccino's style suitably mirrors and have entered into a dramatic world depicted in Melone's coarser style.Melone continued the cycle on the right wall, he painted five scenes of the Passion above the three arches next to the apse.View all images of the fresco decoration in Cremona Cathedral by various artists",36799-carrying.jpg,35316-sketch1.jpg,25926-cremona1.jpg,05439-110madon.jpg,17474-3malvag4.jpg,00954-02virgin.jpg,37575-cleopatr.jpg,04511-virgin_c.jpg,40266-organ_2.jpg,16534-s_jerome.jpg,3
24,Frans Post,"HALS, Frans",portrait,Dutch,1601-1650,"The identification of the friendly sitter  for this small informal portrait as the Haarlem landscapist Frans Post (c. 1612-1680) is based on an inscription written on the lower margin of an impression of the first state of Jonas Suyderhoef's reverses engraving of it at the Albertina, Vienna.

26,Hagar and Ishmael Banished by Abraham,"VERHAGHEN, Pieter Jozef",religious,Flemish,1751-1800,"A series of recent studies has led to something of a new attitude towards Flemish painting in the 18th century. Until fairly recently, the art of this period was considered to be rather inferior, despite the high artistic output, because of its perceived lack of innovation. On the one hand, Flemish artists of the 18th century continued to live off the inheritance of Rubens, whose art seemed unsurpassable. Artists such as Pieter Jozef Verhaghen worked entirely in the tradition of Rubens, and although he spent a few years in Italy, there are few traces of this in his work. His Hagar and Ishmael banished by Abraham, painted for the abbey at Tongerlo, has all the outward characteristics of a baroque painting, but lacks Rubens expressiveness. Meanwhile, other artists had fallen under the spell of France with its trend-setting rococo artists. This development was, however, rather out of character with Flemish artistic tradition",18104-2tosse1.jpg,24259-judith.jpg,10016-m_olives.jpg,31268-adoratio.jpg,36075-5window.jpg,25051-double1.jpg,42510-hagar_is.jpg,35665-deesis2.jpg,42791-1sacris.jpg,36299-man_sorr.jpg,7
27,Hercules and Antaeus,"SAMACCHINI, Orazio",mythological,Italian,1551-1600,"With such paintings as painted tapestry, painting within a painting it became possible to use the flat surface of a ceiling vault for narrative depictions. Given a corresponding design of the fictive architecture of a vault structure it became possible to combine an illusory extension of the room upward with an outward extension.

28,Il Ridotto,"LONGHI, Pietro",genre,Italian,1701-1750,"Pietro Longhi was first a pupil of Balestra and then of Crespi whose art was the source of his realism, which expressed a sober and sincere inner world, and a delight in detailed and fresh narrative. He conveyed his realism with wit and ease, whereas the immediacy with which he approached the landscape enriched his painting with a unique quality. Up to a certain point these elements can be discerned in pre-revolution French painting (Watteau, Chardin, Boucher and Lancret), whose influence also made itself felt in Pietro Longhi's realism. Only here and there did grotesque features appear in his art; he saw his figures with the eye of a sage and a gentle and witty impertinence is to be found in many of the scenes he depicted.Pietro Longhi became, by means of his genre-painting, one of the most faithful chroniclers of his age, and one who conjured up a regrettably vanished civilization. It should be borne in mind, however, that his connection with Goldoni and the teachings of Emilia encouraged him, through the observation of reality, to perform a kind of analysis of ""social depths""; he did not want to cause an upheaval but only wanted to point out &#151; perhaps tendentiously &#151; the ineptitude of a declining class of society. Although he did not pass sentence, he allowed his opinion to be known, being fully aware that changes were imminent. Sometimes he would ironically represent certain dandies, abbots and virgins",08667-01soap.jpg,20578-company5.jpg,04578-pendant2.jpg,29311-painter.jpg,09848-courb111.jpg,04586-young_gi.jpg,06918-elegantw.jpg,21435-fetewood.jpg,22942-09ridott.jpg,03173-spicesho.jpg,9
29,Illusionistic window,"SALVIATI, Cecchino del",religious,Italian,1501-1550,"Vasari points out that Salviati, in addition to his   work on the narrative frescoes, also executed some of the decorative details - the window framing between his two scenes, but also the illusionistic window to the right of the Birth of St John the Baptist scene. These window framings, with their nude youths atop festoons of fruit, are primarily decorative displays of artistic virtuosity; at the same time they contain elements - for example the tondo with the chiaroscuro depiction of Time revealing Truth - that can likewise easily be seen as referring to the theological content of the frescoes as well as to the work of the confraternity",18104-2tosse1.jpg,24259-judith.jpg,10016-m_olives.jpg,31268-adoratio.jpg,36075-5window.jpg,25051-double1.jpg,42510-hagar_is.jpg,35665-deesis2.jpg,42791-1sacris.jpg,36299-man_sorr.jpg,5

40,Mercury and Argus,"RUBENS, Peter Paul",mythological,Flemish,1601-1650,"The source of the subject is Ovid's Metamorphoses.The love affairs of gods never bode well for mortals; there were times when they caused nothing but suffering even for some of the nymphs. Io, the beautiful daughter of the river god Inachus, fell prey to the passion of Jupiter, who - in order to hide her from his jealous wife - turned the girl into a cow. The wily Juno talked her husband into giving her the fine-looking animal and had the hundred-eyed Argus guard it. Jupiter gave Mercury the task of killing the wicked guard. The inventive god (the Greeks called him ""Hermes dolios"", the schemer) approached the meadows, herding some goats which he had stolen along the way, and played songs on his pipe. The guard was charmed by the new and masterful melodies.Mercury watches intently as Argus is mesmerized by the sound of the flute, and he is already reaching for the weapon with which he will behead the sleepy guardian.Rubens depicted a fipple flute in place of a Pan-pipe. From the aulos used at feasts of Antiquity and the Roman tibia through the medieval bagpipes and Renaissance-Baroque horns and musettes, all the way to the saxophone of our times, every wind instrument was attributed with having a dangerous mesmerizing power",07957-farnes01.jpg,36111-hercules.jpg,05692-sun1.jpg,15337-jupiter.jpg,29406-venus_c.jpg,09498-1wedding.jpg,35516-48mythol.jpg,16883-sheba.jpg,40149-birthven.jpg,43562-allegory.jpg,7

42,Paintings of Saints,MASTER THEODERIC,religious,Bohemian,1351-1400,"Master Theoderic, a highly original artist, broke free of the styles that were dominated by Italian, Austrian and French art and tried to develop his own distinctive style. Painted between 1360 and 1365, the 30 icon-like portraits of the saints which decorate the Chapel of the Cross at Karlstein Castle are one of the most impressive results of these efforts. The robust features of the individual saints are impressively depicted.Three-dimensional objects have been added, such as carved coats-of-arms, mounted in the manner of collages on the surface of the paintings. Ornamented with discs of gilded Venetian glass and strips of marble encrusted with semiprecious stones, the chapel seems like a Byzantine treasure chamber.

The traditional identification of the sitter as Fragonard's friend and fellow artist Hubert Robert seems also untenable.

50,Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife,"EYCK, Jan van",portrait,Flemish,1401-1450,"""The Arnolfini Marriage"" is a name that has been given to this untitled double portrait by Jan van Eyck, now in the National Gallery, London. It is one of the greatest celebrations of human mutuality. Like Rembrandt's ""Jewish Bride"", this painting reveals to us the inner meaning of a true marriage. Giovanni Arnolfini, a prosperous Italian banker who had settled in Bruges, and his wife Giovanna Cenami, stand side by side in the bridal chamber, facing towards the viewer. The husband is holding out his wife's hand.Despite the restricted space, the painter has contrived to surround them with a host of symbols. To the left, the oranges placed on the low table and the windowsill are a reminder of an original innocence, of an age before sin. Unless, that is, they are not in fact oranges but apples (it is difficult to be certain), in which case they would represent the temptation of knowledge and the Fall. Above the couple's heads, the candle that has been left burning in broad daylight on one of the branches of an ornate copper chandelier can be interpreted as the nuptial flame, or as the eye of God. The small dog in the foreground is an emblem of fidelity and love. Meanwhile, the marriage bed with its bright red curtains evokes the physical act of love which, according to Christian doctrine, is an essential part of the perfect union of man and wife.Although all these different elements are highly charged with meaning, they are of secondary importance compared to the mirror, the focal point of the whole composition. It has often been noted that two tiny figures can be seen reflected in it, their image captured as they cross the threshold of the room. They are the painter himself and a young man, doubtless arriving to act as witnesses to the marriage. The essential point, however, is the fact that the convex mirror is able to absorb and reflect in a single image both the floor and the ceiling of the room, as well as the sky and the garden outside, both of which are otherwise barely visible through the side window. The mirror thus acts as a sort of hole in the texture of space. It sucks the entire visual world into itself, transforming it into a representation.The cubic space in which the Arnolfinis stand is itself a prefiguration of the techniques of perspective which were still to come. Van Eyck practised perspective on a purely heuristic basis, unaware of the laws by which it was governed. In this picture, he uses the mirror precisely in order to explode the limits of the space to which his technique gives him access as soon as it threatens to limit him",23845-3manet04.jpg,19213-77post.jpg,13403-15arnol.jpg,12490-05self26.jpg,17551-09portra.jpg,13646-23ferenc.jpg,37416-portlady.jpg,34215-jesuit.jpg,29860-margaret.jpg,17546-04portra.jpg,3
51,Portrait of Jan Gaspar Gevartius,"RUBENS, Peter Paul",portrait,Flemish,1601-1650,"This is a portrait of Rubens' friend Jan Gaspar Gevaerts (1593-1666). He was a reputable philologist, Neo-Latin poet and historiographer. Characteristically for his intellectual circles he had his name Latinized to Gevartius.After a stay in Holland and Paris Gevartius became the Registrar of the city of Antwerp. In this function he was in charge of official ceremonies in the city and in 1635 helped Rubens with the ""Pompa Introitus Ferdinandi"", one of Rubens most impressive projects.Rubens here intends to represent his friend's humanist attitude: he is sitting at his desk, with a bust of the Roman Emperor and philosopher Marcus Aurelius, on whom he wrote an unpublished commentary. The painting is dated around 1628. The composition of the work is not baroque, but fits more easily into the 16th-century tradition of homely portraits of humanists",13439-alfieri.jpg,19203-71pend2.jpg,32173-louis_13.jpg,11142-1870s_07.jpg,32528-2princes.jpg,35578-23gevart.jpg,33531-42portra.jpg,41022-17portra.jpg,12350-portlady.jpg,12998-selfpor1.jpg,6

The central section depicts the Madonna holding her Child and surrounded by music-making angels, seated on a marble throne decorated with Roman-inspired reliefs. The naturalistic trompe l'oeil garlands, seemingly affixed to the top of the picture, create a rapport with the garlands held by the putti in the marble relief at the top of the throne.

58,Self-Portrait at 26,"DRER, Albrecht",portrait,German,1501-1550,"This self portrait is dated 1498 and inscribed: `I have thus painted myself. I was 26 years old. Albrecht Drer.' Since the artist turned 27 on the 21 May, the picture must date from the beginning of the year. The artist's pose is self confident, showing him standing upright and turning slightly to lean his right arm on a ledge. D�rer's figure fills the picture, with his hat almost touching the top. His face and neck glow from the light streaming into the room and his long curly hair is painstakingly depicted. Unlike his earlier self portrait, he now has a proper beard, which was then unusual among young men. Nine years later D�rer wrote an ironic poem in which he described himself as `the painter with the hairy beard'.The artist's clothing is flamboyant. His elegant jacket is edged with black and beneath this he wears a white, pleated shirt, embroidered along the neckline. His jaunty hat is striped, to match the jacket. Over his left shoulder hangs a light-brown cloak, tied around his neck with a twisted cord. He wears fine kid gloves.Inside the room is a tall archway, partly framing D�rer's head, and to the right a window opens out onto an exquisite landscape. Green fields give way to a tree-ringed lake and beyond are snow-capped mountains, probably a reminder of D�rer's journey over the Alps three years earlier. Depicting a distant landscape, viewed through a window, was a device borrowed from Netherlandish portraiture.The Germans still tended to consider the artist as a craftsman, as had been the conventional view during the Middle Ages. This was bitterly unacceptable to D�rer, whose second Self-Portrait (out of three) shows him as slender and aristocratic, a haughty and foppish youth, ringletted and impassive. His stylish and expensive costume indicates, like the dramatic mountain view through the window (implying wider horizons), that he considers himself no mere limited provincial. What D�rer insists on above all else is his dignity, and this was a quality that he allowed to others too.This picture was acquired by Charles I of England and later bought by Philip IV of Spain",23845-3manet04.jpg,19213-77post.jpg,13403-15arnol.jpg,12490-05self26.jpg,17551-09portra.jpg,13646-23ferenc.jpg,37416-portlady.jpg,34215-jesuit.jpg,29860-margaret.jpg,17546-04portra.jpg,4

60,Skull with Burning Cigarette,"GOGH, Vincent van",still-life,Dutch,1851-1900,"Catalogue numbers: F 212, JH 999.This painting is in many ways the key Antwerp picture by van Gogh. He was mocking the procedure in drawing classes, where a skeleton invariably served as the basis of anatomical studies. The lifelessness of the skeleton represented the very opposite of what van Gogh wanted a picture to express. With the burning cigarette jammed in its teeth, the skeleton, though still nothing but dead bones, has acquired a grotesquely funny hint of life",38105-vanitas.jpg,19439-stil_lif.jpg,27130-still_2.jpg,00097-still_fr.jpg,17027-antwerp6.jpg,10768-twoteals.jpg,33315-stilmelo.jpg,35884-gamestil.jpg,04599-medici4.jpg,29899-stil-flo.jpg,5
61,Soap Bubbles,"CHARDIN, Jean-Baptiste-Simon",genre,French,1701-1750,"There are three known autograph versions of Soap Bubbles, two in horizontal formats (in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art), and the vertical composition in Washington. In each of the known versions, an adolescent boy leans on a window ledge  fringed with vines and blows through a straw, intensely concentrating on the large soap bubble at its tip. A young child strains over the ledge to watch.An engraving of the Soap Bubbles, published in 1739, matches none of the three extant paintings precisely. It seems most likely that there existed a fourth version, now lost",08667-01soap.jpg,20578-company5.jpg,04578-pendant2.jpg,29311-painter.jpg,09848-courb111.jpg,04586-young_gi.jpg,06918-elegantw.jpg,21435-fetewood.jpg,22942-09ridott.jpg,03173-spicesho.jpg,1
62,St George and the Princess,"TURA, Cosm?",religious,Italian,1451-1500,"In 1469 the cover of the organ of the Cathedral in Ferrara was painted by Tura. The Annunciation was visible in the closed state of the organ, while in the open state the panel representing St George and the Dragon was shown. The cover of the organ was transferred to the Museum in 1735.The organ frontal for the Cathedral must serve as an introduction to the painter, although he was about thirty-nine years old when it was finished and obviously a fully formed painter. The shutters were painted with tempera, although Tura seems frequently to have employed oils as well. They are emotionally charged, full of movement and intense expressionism. In the St George the frightened princess, placed close to the picture plane, moves swiftly to the left of the single canvas she occupies. Her fluttering, irregular draperies with decisive hills and valleys are carefully studied, but they do not follow the structure of her body or even her pose, becoming instead alive and rebelliously independent of the forms they hide.Light is effectively rendered as an expressive device without becoming a particularly naturalistic component, striking here and there, helter-skelter, although a certain concentration on the left may be isolated. Highlights are also found on the right-hand edges of forms, especially in the canvas showing St George impaling the dragon. Color is equally antinaturalistic. The tight-fitting leather costume of the saint is outlined, pale maroon against a golden sky. His gray horse, ferociously participating in the confrontation, is accentuated by a calligraphic arrangement of thin red straps. There are strong echoes of Mantegna, perhaps in part filtered through Squarcione, in motives like the rendering of the winding trail with figures on the hill behind the princess and a tight application of paint, which permits abundant minuscule detail. Critics have called attention to connections with later Donatello, especially with his reliefs made for nearby Padua. These are difficult to isolate within the personal expressive idiom of the St George, except for the shared intensity in treating sacred figures and narratives",36799-carrying.jpg,35316-sketch1.jpg,25926-cremona1.jpg,05439-110madon.jpg,17474-3malvag4.jpg,00954-02virgin.jpg,37575-cleopatr.jpg,04511-virgin_c.jpg,40266-organ_2.jpg,16534-s_jerome.jpg,9

64,St Jerome,GIOVANNI ANGELO D'ANTONIO,religious,Italian,1451-1500,"This panel is from the upper register of a reconstructed polyptych. The companion panels in the upper register show Sts Sebastian and Peter, the Crucifixion and St Lawrence. The main panels with which the upper register has been framed since 1925 represent the Madonna and Child with angels, flanked by, on the left, Sts Augustine and Catherine of Alexandria and, on the right, Sts Appolonia and Nicholas of Tolentino.St Jerome is the most moving of the figural panels in the upper register. He is shown with his symbol, the lion, placing its paws on the saint while licking him as would a dog. Jerome is scrutinizing the text of the Vulgate, which he holds in front of him. Staring at the text through gilded pince-nez, his brows knitted in concentration, he reads aloud, his mouth half open, revealing white teeth.The panels forming the upper register come from the Benedictine abbey in Gualdo Tadino, which must have been the original location of the altarpiece to which they belonged",36799-carrying.jpg,35316-sketch1.jpg,25926-cremona1.jpg,05439-110madon.jpg,17474-3malvag4.jpg,00954-02virgin.jpg,37575-cleopatr.jpg,04511-virgin_c.jpg,40266-organ_2.jpg,16534-s_jerome.jpg,10
65,St Luke Drawing a Portrait of the Madonna,"WEYDEN, Rogier van der",religious,Flemish,1401-1450,"A sixth-century legend presents Luke as the painter of a number of icons of the Virgin. He is therefore given the status of the painter ""par excellence"", able to capture even the Virgin on canvas. Luke has been the patron of various painters' guilds since the fifteenth century.Depicted in the background of the painting are Mary's parents, Joachim and Anne. The evangelist, who supposedly practiced medicine, is shown dressed like a Flemish doctor; in the Middle Ages he was considered the patron saint of painters, physicians, and apothecaries. It has been suggested that this  is a self-portrait. The way in which Luke holds the stylus resembles the technique artists used to avoid smudging drawings with the heel of the hand.There are a few versions of this painting the most significants being in Boston and Munich",43957-2luke.jpg,05008-findmose.jpg,32539-mad_chil.jpg,32267-19gather.jpg,00781-3predel4.jpg,25224-karlstei.jpg,01094-christ.jpg,37004-service.jpg,44046-1diptych.jpg,04389-annuncia.jpg,1
66,"St Peter Martyr with St Nicholas of Bari, St Benedict and an Angel Musician",CIMA da Conegliano,religious,Italian,1451-1500,"The painting is from the church of Corpus Domini in Venice. It was commissioned by Benedetto Carloni in his woill of November 5, 1504. It is signed in Latin on the paper on the base: ""JOANIS BAPTISTA CIMA / CONEGLIAN(ENS)IS.""Cima must have been attracted at a very early age to Venice, where he was fascinated by the elder Bellini and Antonello da Messina. From them he acquired a pictorial repertory suited to his work on a provincial circuit, and like Montagna and Alvise Vivarini, he propagated their approach to painting on the mainland and in Emilia. His work, however, has richer colour and warmth, through the influence of Giorgione.This altarpiece shows Cima's typical mixture of the archaic and the modern. The impeccably harmonious fifteenth-century construction of architecture and figures is accompanied by a modern sunny atmosphere and a landscape steeped in luminous vapour. The traveling artist has evoked memories of his birthplace, setting it on the shores of a quiet lake and peopling it with shepherds, as in an Arcadian dream",14788-giustina.jpg,24109-95magi.jpg,17505-14virgin.jpg,16385-chris13.jpg,10534-madonna.jpg,08864-12peter.jpg,02764-eccehomo.jpg,23189-32monaco.jpg,34269-phaeton.jpg,24000-zeno04.jpg,6
67,Still-Life,"HEEM, Jan Davidsz. de",still-life,Dutch,1601-1650,"De Heem's still-life paintings initially followed the style of the Haarlem school, but later drew closer to the more lavish Flemish style of large-scale still-lifes. Nevertheless, certain Dutch elements cannot be overlooked. In this painting, they are particularly evident at the points where a ""dialectical principle"" determines the compositional structure.A mass of fruit and flowers ranging from ripe chestnuts to blackberries, from columbine to roses, has been arranged on a stone slab. A wide variety of surfaces, each with a different effect in light, with pure or iridescent colours, is spread out before us. Yet snails are already crawling across the vine leaves, the foliage is discoloured and withering and, the ears of grain are curling, the peach has burst its skin, the citrus fruit is half peeled, the white carnation is dried and drooping over the table edge.At the very point where the image bears an iconographic message of the transience of worldly life in the form of nature's riches, we see these things in their last bloom of beauty. Just as a ruin could represent the picturesque appeal of architecture, so too can a vine leaf riddled with snails seem picturesque in the full and final flowering of its beauty",38105-vanitas.jpg,19439-stil_lif.jpg,27130-still_2.jpg,00097-still_fr.jpg,17027-antwerp6.jpg,10768-twoteals.jpg,33315-stilmelo.jpg,35884-gamestil.jpg,04599-medici4.jpg,29899-stil-flo.jpg,2

70,Still-Life with Fruit and Crystal Vase,"AELST, Willem van",still-life,Dutch,1651-1700,"Intense colours characterize the still-lifes of Van Aelst, who worked for a time in France and Italy. In this painting, which was commissioned by Cardinal Giovan Carlo de' Medici, the intense blue of the table-cloth catches one's eye. The large crystal vase in the centre of the composition was probably in the possession of the Medici family. The painter placed his signature and the date on the hem of the white tablecloth: W.A.Aelst. 1652",38105-vanitas.jpg,19439-stil_lif.jpg,27130-still_2.jpg,00097-still_fr.jpg,17027-antwerp6.jpg,10768-twoteals.jpg,33315-stilmelo.jpg,35884-gamestil.jpg,04599-medici4.jpg,29899-stil-flo.jpg,4
71,Still-Life with Fruits,"MIGNON, Abraham",still-life,German,1651-1700,Notable among the artists Jan Davidsz. de Heem trained during his stay in Utrecht who then worked in his manner is the flower and fruit specialist Abraham Mignon,38105-vanitas.jpg,19439-stil_lif.jpg,27130-still_2.jpg,00097-still_fr.jpg,17027-antwerp6.jpg,10768-twoteals.jpg,33315-stilmelo.jpg,35884-gamestil.jpg,04599-medici4.jpg,29899-stil-flo.jpg,3
72,The Adoration of the Christ Child,PIERO DI COSIMO,religious,Italian,1451-1500,"This panel presents a number of compositional and symbolic peculiarities: St Joseph is represented in the background, visible in the middle through the door of the hut, grazing the ox and the donkey, usually depicted next to the Infant Jesus; angels playing long flutes take the place of the shepherds and Magi; the white bird on the beam of the roof (a dove?), perhaps an allusion to the Holy Spirit that descended to Mary. The Virgin's usual blue cloak is adorned with the star of the Byzantine tradition and behind her hangs a humble saddle. The Infant St John has significantly handed the cross, symbol of the Passion, to the child, who, as was common in Tuscan painting, is lying on a sheet and a sack. The figure of the Madonna, like those of the angels, fits in perfectly with the curved edge of the panel, perhaps painted to celebrate a birth, as was customary at the time. Tradition and innovation are fused in this painting, of which there is another version in the Hermitage, considered by some the original and by others a replica of the tondo in the Galleria Borghese",18104-2tosse1.jpg,24259-judith.jpg,10016-m_olives.jpg,31268-adoratio.jpg,36075-5window.jpg,25051-double1.jpg,42510-hagar_is.jpg,35665-deesis2.jpg,42791-1sacris.jpg,36299-man_sorr.jpg,4
73,The Adoration of the Magi,MASTER of the Holy Kinship,religious,German,1501-1550,"This double-sided panel once formed the wing of a now lost altarpiece, with the Adoration of the Magi originally serving as the interior panel and the Throne of Grace as the exterior. Formerly, the panel was in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. It was sold for the Acquisitions Fund in 2013.The style of this master and his workshop was greatly influenced by Flemish painters, in particular, Hugo van der Goes, whose Monforte Altarpiece may be seen as a direct inspiration for the individual figures in this work (particularly the second kneeling King in the Adoration). Furthermore, the picture is indicative of the influence which Rogier van der Weyden had on the group of Cologne painters working at the turn of the 16th century. Such influence on the present work can be seen in Rogier's Columba Altarpiece, which utilizes a similar spatial construction and figural arrangement found in the Adoration here",18104-2tosse1.jpg,24259-judith.jpg,10016-m_olives.jpg,31268-adoratio.jpg,36075-5window.jpg,25051-double1.jpg,42510-hagar_is.jpg,35665-deesis2.jpg,42791-1sacris.jpg,36299-man_sorr.jpg,6
74,The Coronation of the Virgin,LORENZO Monaco,religious,Italian,1401-1450,"From the high altar of the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli, where Lorenzo was a monk. Signed and dated. The Scenes of the Life of St Benedict in the predella, with their fairy tale charm, are to be reckoned among the highest achievements of the master.Lorenzo's elegant style reached maturity in this very large altarpiece.In this painting the edges of the figures' garments have an animation quite independent of the actual movement of the figures. Although the composition of the painting is quite conventional, the figures display a new fluidity in their poses and in the movements of their drapery which is suggestive of the International Style then being employed in sculpture by Ghiberti and Niccol&#242; Lamberti. Surface patterns vie for attention with the volumes of the figures; even the superimposition of figures tends to read as pattern. Brilliant, light-toned colour and the lavish use of gold and expensive ultramarine blue pigment would have made the painting a strong focal point in the church and would also have testified to its importance and to the donor's extraordinary generosity",14788-giustina.jpg,24109-95magi.jpg,17505-14virgin.jpg,16385-chris13.jpg,10534-madonna.jpg,08864-12peter.jpg,02764-eccehomo.jpg,23189-32monaco.jpg,34269-phaeton.jpg,24000-zeno04.jpg,8
75,The Finding of Moses,BONIFACIO VERONESE,religious,Italian,1501-1550,"This painting and The Feast of Dives (Accademia, Venice) are considered Bonifacio's masterpieces. He has used the subject as an excuse to paint an open-air holiday scene, in which the luxuriousness of the clothes melts into the opulent landscape dotted with little genre scenes. In overall decorative effect, the painting is much like a tapestry. Bonifacio's sources of inspiration include Titian and Dosso, with some influence from northern European painters.",43957-2luke.jpg,05008-findmose.jpg,32539-mad_chil.jpg,32267-19gather.jpg,00781-3predel4.jpg,25224-karlstei.jpg,01094-christ.jpg,37004-service.jpg,44046-1diptych.jpg,04389-annuncia.jpg,2
76,The Galleria Farnese,"CARRACCI, Annibale",mythological,Italian,1551-1600,"In 1597 Cardinal Odoardo Farnese commissioned Annibale Carracci's great masterpiece, the ceiling of the Galleria Farnese in the Palazzo Farnese, the most splendid and influential ceiling decoration in Rome since that of the Sistine Chapel. Annibale's brother Agostino assisted him on at least two of the scenes until they quarrelled and Agostino left Rome. In contrast to the earlier interpretation which saw them as a Neoplatonic allegory of the victory of Celestial Love over physical passion, in recent years Annibale's frescoes have generally been regarded as a witty and joyous celebration of the classical gods in love.During the 1570s and 1580s fresco cycles with mythological subjects had been relatively unfashionable in Rome, since the climate of the Counter Reformation favoured religious decoration, even in secular buildings such as palaces and villas. It may be a measure of the Catholic Church's confidence in winning the battle for souls that it could increasingly tolerate such overtly erotic decoration, even in a cardinal's palace, albeit in what was probably one of the more private rooms. Besides celebrating love's power to conquer, it is likely that the frescoes were intended to complement the antique statues, some of the finest in one of Rome's most magnificent collection of antiquities, which were displayed there",07957-farnes01.jpg,36111-hercules.jpg,05692-sun1.jpg,15337-jupiter.jpg,29406-venus_c.jpg,09498-1wedding.jpg,35516-48mythol.jpg,16883-sheba.jpg,40149-birthven.jpg,43562-allegory.jpg,1

At the other side of the ledge an aged Joseph leans on his walking stick.

79,The Jews Gathering the Manna in the Desert,"POUSSIN, Nicolas",religious,French,1601-1650,"It was already apparent to Poussin's contemporaries that the artist had given much thought, in The Israelites Gathering Manna, to the means by which painting could unfold a sequence of events before the eyes of the viewer. The artist combines selected aspects of the biblical story into one scene, so as to illustrate the scale of the Israelites' divine rescue from hunger and misery.This painting can be considered a variation on the Raphael fresco, The School of Athens, in the Vatican. Moses in particular, in his draperies and pointing gesture, directly cites the figure of Plato in Raphael's fresco. Poussin has simply transformed the latter's architectural backdrop into a rock formation and rotated the setting - which in the fresco lies parallel to the pictorial plane - as if on a turntable towards the right, so that it now leads away at a diagonal into the depths",43957-2luke.jpg,05008-findmose.jpg,32539-mad_chil.jpg,32267-19gather.jpg,00781-3predel4.jpg,25224-karlstei.jpg,01094-christ.jpg,37004-service.jpg,44046-1diptych.jpg,04389-annuncia.jpg,4
80,The Leaping Horse,"CONSTABLE, John",landscape,English,1801-1850,"For some of his large canvases Constable painted full-size oil sketches, The Leaping Horse being an example. Here he has tried to freeze a sudden action - the leap of a barge horse over a cattle barrier on the Stour towpath. But to the modern observer his own description of the picture, written shortly before it was ready for the 1825 Academy exhibition - 'calm &#38; exhilarating, fresh &#38; blowing' - applies more happily to the sketch; the greatest sufferer in the finished canvas is the sky, which has lost its bubbling clouds",42377-souda.jpg,42512-cathedra.jpg,09373-leaping.jpg,08420-figures.jpg,35839-valkhof1.jpg,19686-westerke.jpg,29474-landsuns.jpg,04410-landscap.jpg,18726-guard106.jpg,04981-moonlit.jpg,3

There are five central scenes of the life of the Virgin, one after the other without interruption (23 x 183 cm), namely (from the left). Marriage of the Virgin, The Visitation, Adoration of the Magi, Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, Death of the Virgin.This picture shows the scene of the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. In this scene Joseph, the Virgin, the High Priest and St Anne stand in the foreground, a nave of receding columns extending backwards behind them.

87,The Spice Shop,"BARBIERI, Paolo Antonio",genre,Italian,1601-1650,"Paolo Antonio Barbieri, brother of the famous Guercino, was a master of the still-life. The austere composition of The Spice Shop, in which tall spice jars are arranged in a row parallel to the picture plane, has similarities with the art of Jacopo da Empoli, while the characterization of the youthful and romantic seller of spices reflects aspects of Guercino&#146;s style, though the execution is drier",08667-01soap.jpg,20578-company5.jpg,04578-pendant2.jpg,29311-painter.jpg,09848-courb111.jpg,04586-young_gi.jpg,06918-elegantw.jpg,21435-fetewood.jpg,22942-09ridott.jpg,03173-spicesho.jpg,10
88,The Studio of the Painter,"COURBET, Gustave",genre,French,1851-1900,"The subtitle of the huge painting is Real Allegory of Seven Years of My Artistic and Moral Life. Courbet did not like to talk about his art, but made an exception for this work: ""It is the moral and physical story of my studio. ... it is the world that comes to be painted. .. .The painting is divided into two parts. I am in the middle, painting. On the right are... friends... On the left, the other world of trivial life...""In 1854, Courbet began work on The Studio which he would like to submit for the Exposition universelle. Courbet described the painting in a letter: ""I see society with its concerns and passions; it is the world that comes to be painted.... The scene takes place in my atelier in Paris. The painting is divided into two parts. I am in the middle, painting. On the right are the shareholders, that is, friends, workers, devotees of the art world. On the left, the other world of trivial life, the people, misery, poverty, wealth, the exploited and the exploiters, the people who live off death.""The Studio presents a completely original synthesis and a thoroughly unexpected confrontation. There is no parallel in Courbet's later career for this generous, indeed baroque, vision, in which models and minds come together. Courbet sought to present the studio as an overall image of the role of art. He declared the autonomy and subjectivity of his perception in the face of history and the real world, both of which he had in his own way summoned into the studio. The master of ceremonies is seen painting a landscape, a practice that was to become increasingly central during the rest of his life. Meanwhile, the notion of a group portrait as homage or allegory in the spirit of Frans Hals, Rembrandt or Philippe de Champaigne, is perfectly achieved.The painting was a success at the Exposition, however, it did not find a buyer, remaining rolled up in a corner of the rue Hautefeuille studio till 1881, when Courbet's sister Juliette, his sole heir, decided to sell it. By then it had become something of a burden. It raised 21,000 francs (some 3,200 euros). Only in 1920 was it acquired by the Louvre, finding its way to the Mus�e d'Orsay some sixty years later",08667-01soap.jpg,20578-company5.jpg,04578-pendant2.jpg,29311-painter.jpg,09848-courb111.jpg,04586-young_gi.jpg,06918-elegantw.jpg,21435-fetewood.jpg,22942-09ridott.jpg,03173-spicesho.jpg,5
89,The Valkhof at Nijmegen,"RUYSDAEL, Salomon van",landscape,Dutch,1601-1650,"The picture shows the Valkhof at Nijmegen with a ferry crossing the river Waal. The site of the medieval Valkhof, the fortress built on Roman foundations that dominates the city, was and indeed still is dramatic, towering over a bend in the river. Both Ruysdael and Van Goyen painted it on several occasions",42377-souda.jpg,42512-cathedra.jpg,09373-leaping.jpg,08420-figures.jpg,35839-valkhof1.jpg,19686-westerke.jpg,29474-landsuns.jpg,04410-landscap.jpg,18726-guard106.jpg,04981-moonlit.jpg,5
90,The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis,CORNELIS VAN HAARLEM,mythological,Dutch,1551-1600,"The Haarlem government commissioned this painting to decorate a guesthouse for the Orange family and other dignitaries. The painting's reference to the beginnings of the Trojan War presented an impressive reminder that even trivial discord causes devastating wars. This was a topical message in Haarlem, which had suffered debilitating defeat in a Spanish siege of 1573. The work also showcased Haarlem's patronage of sophisticated international history painting.In this painting, depicting events leading up to the Trojan War, Cornelis van Haarlem represented the assembled gods as naked muscle-men and soft-skinned women, in endlessly varied poses. Their idealized, heroic bodies befit their immortality and the ominous event they witness. These figures were clearly based on drawings after the nude which Cornelis could have made in the small academy in Haarlem. His grand style would have reminded knowledgeable viewers of the history painting of the Italian Renaissance, specifically of Michelangelo and his followers, and of the praise for idealized nudity and difficult poses in sophisticated art theory",07957-farnes01.jpg,36111-hercules.jpg,05692-sun1.jpg,15337-jupiter.jpg,29406-venus_c.jpg,09498-1wedding.jpg,35516-48mythol.jpg,16883-sheba.jpg,40149-birthven.jpg,43562-allegory.jpg,6

97,"View of the Westerkerk, Amsterdam","HEYDEN, Jan van der",landscape,Dutch,1651-1700,"The works of Jan van der Heyden, one of the finest city-view specialists, are responsible for our general impressions of seventeenth-century Amsterdam. In paintings such as his View of the Westerkerk he presented a pristine, sunny image of the city in the 1670s. These cityscapes, many of which inventively recombine actual and fictional buildings, are as interesting for their omissions as for their inclusions. Both serious and comic descriptions of Amsterdam called attention to the busy traffic of people and carts, to the crying children and fighting street dwellers, to dirt and to crime, but van der Heyden's city views edit out congestion, noise, transgression, and dust, and gloss over class distinctions. They thereby present a salutary image of a unified, prosperous city, a beautifully painted fiction affordable only to its prosperous elite.Van der Heyden's painting takes as its centerpiece the Westerkerk, a church designed in 1620 by Hendrick de Keyser, then the city's most famous architect. Although the structure owed much to earlier Netherlandish designs executed in warmly coloured local brick, its details are innovative. To contemporaries the bell tower, completed in 1638, must have looked cosmopolitan with its three levels of classical columns in stone, topped by brackets that support a fanciful bulb. As the largest Protestant church built up to that time, it constituted a local answer to the magnificent tradition of Catholic building.Although de Keyser's church primarily served the Jordaan, a modest neighbourhood, van der Heyden represented it as seen from the stately Keizersgracht, the new Emperor's Canal",42377-souda.jpg,42512-cathedra.jpg,09373-leaping.jpg,08420-figures.jpg,35839-valkhof1.jpg,19686-westerke.jpg,29474-landsuns.jpg,04410-landscap.jpg,18726-guard106.jpg,04981-moonlit.jpg,6
